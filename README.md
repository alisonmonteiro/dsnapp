# DSN App

Dead Simple Notes App. A simple experiment created with Next.js, Tailwind, TypesSript, Shadcn/UI, and Supabase.

## Getting Started

First, create a Supabase account and start a new project. After that, create a new table using [this](https://github.com/alisonmonteiro/dsnapp/blob/main/src/scripts/tables.sql) script.

Secondly, create an `.env` file based on the `.env.example` provided in this repository.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Last but not least, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
